+ Co-option often occurs using some evolved feature of the gene in question, although perhaps in a surprising way (29, 34, 35)
+ Co-option can also result in proteins being used for functions that are seemingly unrelated to their evolved role (37, 38, 39)


+ In the absence of other factors, gene duplications are expected to be either selectively neutral(43) or detrimental(44, 46)
+ Three life stages of a duplicate gene pair: 
	+ creation (mutation in a single individual)
	+ fixationâpreservation (in the whole population by selection or drift)
		+ Neofunctionalization:
			+ New function on one member of a duplicate gene pair occurs after the duplication(51)
			+ Gene appropriated for adaptation after duplication has a function that is closely related to the function required => novelty is built on a conserved enzymatic mechanism.
		+ Subfunctionalization:
			+ Functions of an ancestrally multifunctional gene have become divided up neutrally among the daughter copies (degeneration, complementation model) (9, 37, 50)
			+ escape from adaptive conflict (EAC) model (59â61): The two functions of the ancestral gene cannot simultaneously be optimized by natural selection. After gene duplication, the two daughter genes can escape from the conflict.
			+ Several studies have suggested that the extant features of networks, such as those of proteinâprotein interactions and transcriptional regulation, are compatible with a node (gene) duplication model (64â66)
		+ Dosage
			+ Duplicate gene pairs  preserved by selection for increased gene dosage (70) => selectively advantageous at birth
			+ Selection for higher gene dosage might increase the likelihood of a later neofunctionalization event by prolonging the half-life of a duplicate gene pair.
		+ Building new functions by dosage selection
			+ A gene does not address only one function it also encode minor activities (78) (promiscuous protein activities)
			+ These minor activities can also evolve into new functions: reservoir of functional novelty
			+ Combine Selection for gene dosage and Neofunctionalization of minor activities : adaptive amplification (88,89) adaptive radiation(90) or IAD(45, 90) model
				+ Duplications are selected in certain genes with weak but beneficial activities.
				+ The tandem arrays of duplicates that this selection maintains have an increased rate of beneficial, activity-enhancing mutations owing to the large number of mutational targets.
				+ Once such muta- tions have been fixed, selection to maintain the duplicated array is reduced and the extra copies are lost
				+ leaving only the ancestral gene and the new duplicate with a novel function
	+ optimization
	+ (loss of a duplication is by far the most common fate)
