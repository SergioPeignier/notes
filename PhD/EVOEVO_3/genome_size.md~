+ genome size is to date the only statistically significant determinant of IS abundance (Touchon & Rocha, 2007). Indeed, the numbers and density of IS increase rapidly with genome size, which is the exact inverse trend found for the density of genes under strong selection such as essential genes, suggesting that ISs are as strongly counter-selected as the average gene is under strong selection.

+ The size of genomes is largely the result of the balance of forces increasing genetic information, horizontal transfer and amplifications, and forces removing genetic information, selection and genetic deletions. 
+ The genome will not increase too much since:
	+ The limiting step in the formation of the amplicon is the creation of the flanking repeats. A deletion of these repeats will result in a sequence that will lead to a new amplicon at very low rates
	+ large tandems of amplicons are expected to cause genetic instability and they create a severe imbalance in the gene dosage. 
	+ These will result in a deletion bias (Koch, 1979).
