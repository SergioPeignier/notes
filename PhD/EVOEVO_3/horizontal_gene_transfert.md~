## [SELECTION FOR GENE CLUSTERING BY TANDEM DUPLICATION](http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.micro.58.030603.123806)

#### Phenomenon evidence

+ Genomic island, describes regions of varied function [...] Differences between islands and their neighboring regions and evidence of mobile genetic elements are indicative of horizontal gene transfer.
+ [In islands] Genetic signatures of mobility are evident, such as integrase genes and flanking direct repeats that are duplications of the insertion site.
+ Islands include large regions encoding variable physiological functions. 
+ New nomenclature aims to emphasize that different chromosomal clusters are associated with alternative transfer mechanisms (e.g., conjugative transposons or integrative plasmids) (9, 107). 
+ Gene clustering may originate as the result of horizontal gene transfer (61, 97).

#### Model (59, 61, 97)
+ According to this model, clustering can be thought of as a selfish property of the genes that allows the **comobilization of a genetic region required for a common function (59).**
+ **Clustering facilitates the introduction of novel traits into different cells**. selective benefit travels with the genes
+ **Clustered genes enable the step-wise construction of novel catabolic pathways by the reorganization of genetic segments (11, 86, 105, 111).**
	+ **Formation of the gene cluster:**
		+ **proximal genes more likely to be transferred**
		+ **One function often involve severall genes**
	+ **Retention of transfered genes:**
		+ **when they provide benefit to the new recipient.**
		+ **Genes repairment by homologus recombination of horizontal transfert: corepair (33)**
	+ **Retention of order:**
		+ Horizontal transfer: Shuffling of genes during evolution through rearrangements is not prevented by Horizontal transfert
		+ Regulatory benefit of cotranscription is often cited as an obvious explanation for operons
