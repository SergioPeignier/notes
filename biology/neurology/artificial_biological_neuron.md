## De pitta presentation
+ Biological neuron model (depolarization, spiking)
+ Point process (the neuron model is simplified into a point process)
+ Poisson point process (common model used)
+ diffusion approximation spiking neuron (assume some type of connection in the network and then assumes that all the spiking are iid)
+ single neuron stochastic dynamics
+ The network is between two states: "random" and "all firing a lot" bistable bifurcation
