 # Asking for a job

 	+ following every instruction (recruiters and hiring managers may look for any excuse to toss your resume)
	+ If the job opening is fresh, apply quickly
	+ Put yourself in the shoes of the hiring manager (keywords to use)
	+ If the application mentions the recruiter?s or hiring manager?s name, you might be able to track down his name to send a personalized note
	
## Getting personal referral
+ Best way to get a job
+ Use friends of friends
+ Build connections with strangers. find someone online. Responding to their tweets on Twitter, commenting on their blog. Get them to know your name and to get them to like you. 
+ Make their work easy. look at the situation through their eyes. Make it as easy as possible for them to get your resume. Attach your resume in the initial e-mail. Write your first letter to them as a cover letter, with concrete reasons why you?re a good fit

## Informational Interview
+ Informal discussion with employee before recruiting process
+ Seek employe for advice 
+ Do not mention word interview
+ Have good well researched questions
+ Ask which is the best way to apply or to get in touch with recruiter

## Reach out to recruiters
 + Write a well-researched tailored letter for the company to a generic one
 + Always find the most relevant recruiter
 + Do not send the resume in the first email
 
 ## Alumni network and beyond
 + Use alumni network or industry groups meetup.com
 
 ## Prepare interviews
+ Do your homework. Research the companies you?re interested in and know which roles you?d be a good fit for. What do they look for in candidates? How can you address those skills in your conversation with a recruiter?+ Prepare questions. Part of your job at a career fair is to show your passion for the company and the job. You should prepare a few open-ended questions to ask the company. This will facilitate conversation, as well as offer both you and the recruiter the chance to discover if there?s a good fit.+ Prepare answers. A company might ask you basic questions about your background. You should be able to talk intelligently about your biggest accomplishments and challenges.+ Practice your elevator pitch. The first 30 seconds with the staff at a career fair is your opportunity to impress. A strong candidate will be able to succinctly communicate her value-add.+ Tailor your resume. There?s no rule that says you can bring only one copy of your resume to a career fair. If you?re applying for different types of positions, create tailored resumes for each position.+ Dress appropriately. The tech world is generally not into suits and ties, but being extremely sloppy is also bad. Jeans and a nice top are generally appropriate for most techie roles. For very businessy roles, slacks might be safest. Your attire at a career fair should be more or less the same as what you would wear to an interview.+ Follow up. If possible, get the business card or e-mail address from the person you talk to, and follow up immediately after the career fair. You should reiterate your interest in the company, explain what you?d bring to the company, and attach a copy of your resume
+ Related to projects: Try to answer the questions: How did he build it? What did he enjoy? What did he learn? What was the hardest part?
+ You should always maintain complete control of where your resume goes.

## Alternative paths
+ Start at a start-up and then get more experience / More courses 
+ Companies hire contractors, they are treated as second class citizens. If you are good and you create contacts you can apply for position
+ In some cases it is a good idea to show in your resume that you get the culture of the company and show imagination (using their own systems to build/share their resumes)
+ Use official groups (Facebook, linkedIn) to show your interest and communication skills and personality

## Networking
