#Ilya presentation
+ When you read you should also make entasis at the same time to mark important thinkgs
+ Avoid speaking to fast (synaptic transmission part)
+ You use some abreviation whiteout introducing them explicitly
+ Really need to add bullets : Home take message of each slide
	+ Sometimes you can make little mistakes, mix-up terms, and if there is nothing written you lose your auditorium
	+ Really control the level of voice: Sometimes you use a very monotonous rhythm for important things and very distinguishable rhythm  for useless things
	+ You use sometimes a tone that could be translated by "and all this shit we do to give a fuck and are uninteresting" : maybe a bad idea
	+ During the first part you were stressed and give the impression of not being prepared ... after a time you are less stressed => You should learn very well the begin of the presentation
	
	
# Remarques des PI
+ Montrer quelques résultats seulement
+ Presentation plus générale et tout le monde devrait pouvoir suivre
+ L'intérêt n'est pas de montrer tout le travail qu'on a fait en détail ... mais de faire une présentation générale et intéressante.
+ Need to show the place of your work in the global picture
+ Add a little summary at the beginning
